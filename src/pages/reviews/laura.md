Chad was the easiest person Iâ€™ve ever worked with for event planning. Seriously, the dude is great. My company rented one of his booths last year for our employee appreciation party. We made him fill out all kinds of corporate forms, he said no problem. He coordinated directly with the venue for where to set up and how to get the booth inside. He took care of everything. Pricing for what you receive is a great deal.
