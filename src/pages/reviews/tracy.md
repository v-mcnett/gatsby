We had a fabulous experience from start to finish with Emerald City Photo Booth. The owner, Chad, was incredibly nice and easy to work with. He and his assistant worked the photo booth at our sonâ€™s bar mitzvah. It was a huge hit with kids and adults alike! Chad was reliable, friendly and responsive. I recommend Emerald City without any reservations!
