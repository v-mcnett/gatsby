I would recommend Emerald City Photo Booth any time! This was a great addition to our event and we appreciate so much that we got a good price for a four hour service. Most booths only give two and that doesnâ€™t give much time for a large group. We love the photos and highly recommend the package with the USB drive, then you get all the pics for your memory book! Great value and wonderful person to work with!
