                  What does it take to reserve a Photo Booth for my event and
                  how do you handle payment?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We require a signed Rental Agreement and $295 deposit to book
                  your event. The rental agreement can be obtained by calling or
                  emailing us. The remaining balance of payment is due 30 days
                  before your event. Payment can be made by check or most major
                  credit cards. Call us today at (360) 367-0329 to see if your
                  date is still available!
                </p>

                  Do the four hours of unlimited photos include setup and
                  breakdown?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  No, we would never charge you for setup and breakdown. It is a
                  continuous 4 hours of picture taking fun for you and your
                  guests! You choose the four hour block that we will operate.
                  We will be there up to two hours ahead of time to setup and
                  once the four hours ends we will begin breakdown.
                </p>
                <h3>Where do you travel?</h3>
                <p>We travel anywhere you want a photo booth!</p>
                <h3>What kind of photos do your booths print?</h3>
                <p>
                  The Photo King booth is the classic booth you think about when
                  you think “Photo Booth”. It takes either three or four
                  pictures and then prints them on a vertical 2×6″ strip. We can
                  replace the fourth pictures with the name of your event to
                  make their pictures a true keepsake!
                </p>
                <h3>Can I see some samples?</h3>
                <p>
                  Sure! Please go to http://emeraldcityphotobooth.smugmug.com
                  and check out the galleries that come free with your package!
                </p>
                <h3>How long does it take for the pictures to print?</h3>
                <p>
                  Once your guests have taken their picture, the prints will be
                  ready in about 8 seconds. If that’s not fast enough, you can
                  reserve additional photo booths for your party at only a
                  fraction of the cost!
                </p>
                <h3>
                  What happens if there is a mechanical problem with the booth?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Our booths are extremely reliable and we have NEVER had a
                  mechanical problem during an event. However, just in case, we
                  always provide an on-site technician during your entire party.
                  We care so much about your satisfaction that we even bring a
                  second $10,000 photo booth with us on the truck as a back up,
                  although we have NEVER had to use it. Nobody else is that
                  crazy about customer service, but we know you only get one
                  chance to get it right!
                </p>
                <h3>Are there any special electrical requirements?</h3>
                <p>
                  The photo booth operates on regular A/C power. We suggest that
                  the booth be placed within 10′ of the electrical outlet.
                </p>
                <h3>Where can you deliver a photo booth?</h3>
                <p>
                  Your photo booth is designed to fit through standard 30″
                  doorways and can fit in most passenger elevators. We can
                  deliver to country clubs, hotels, party halls or any other
                  place you plan your party. We can even deliver the photo booth
                  outside if you provide adequate protection from weather, such
                  as a tent.
                </p>
                <h3>Are there any delivery or break-down charges?</h3>
                <p>Delivery, set-up and removal are included in our prices.</p>
                <h3>How far in advance should I reserve my photo booth?</h3>
                <p>
                  As soon as you know you want one, reserve it! 2019 is booking
                  fast! We typically book twelve to eighteen months in advance
                  but don’t lose hope if your event is right around the corner.
                  Give us a call and we’ll do our best to make it happen!
                </p>
                <h3>Do you offer a military discount?</h3>
                <p>
                  Emerald City Photo Booth is proud to offer a 10 percent
                  discount to all of our military service men and women. This
                  discount applies to all of our packages and is our way of
                  saying thank you!
                </p>
                <h3>How long do I have to wait for prints?</h3>
                <p>Prints are available immediately upon exiting the booth.</p>
                <h3>Can I get a copy of all the photos?</h3>
                <p>Yes, a USB drive will be given to you of all the photos.</p>
                <h3>How does the logo design process work?</h3>
                <p>
                  We will use your graphics, wording and colors to create a logo
                  to fit the photo strip. You will have a chance to request
                  changes or approve the logo before your event.
